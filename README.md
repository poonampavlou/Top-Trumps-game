As part of the final task during an 8 week Introduction to Python course with Code First for Girls, we were asked to collaborate on a group project.
Our version of the Top Trump games allows a user to firstly choose how many points the winning score will be, once confirned, the game will run untl the winning score has been reached.
The user will pick a random number between 1 and 82; this will then pull data from a separate url in relation to a Star Wars character and their name, height, weight and mass will be returned. 
The user will select (from height, weight and mass) which characteristic they wish to use. 
Then a random number is generated for the computers side and then those traits are compared and the winning side scores a point.
We added slight time delays to make it seem more game-like and less robotic, as if the computer is actually taking some time to pick a character!
The game continues until the initial winning score has been achieved by either the computer or the user.
